# Deep Learning Tutorial

This repository contains contains scripts and notes for understanding the various aspects of Deep Learning. The scripts are written using TensorFlow, which is an open source machine learning framework.

## Installing TensorFlow
TensorFlow can be installed by following the directions given [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). It is recommended to install it using pip, and running it in a virtual environment.

To test the installation, create a virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter. Activate the virtual environment and run the following scripts:

* If you intend to use Jupyter Notebook (which is what I will be using for the course), run the file `Test_Install/test_tf.ipynb` interactively from the Jupyter environment. Instructions to install Jupyter Notebook are available [here](https://jupyter.org/install). You can find instructions on how to use Jupyter notebook inside a virtual environment over [here](https://anbasile.github.io/programming/2017/06/25/jupyter-venv/).

* If you intend to run python scripts directly from the terminal, test the install by running the following command from the parent directory

		python Test_Install/test_tf.py
